# senate_fundraising_analysis

In this project, I set out to determine whether the amount of money raised by a U.S. Senate candidate had an empirical effect on his or her result in the election.  I used data from the 2020 General Election, collecting information from the 20 candidates who raised the most cash.  

In order to make the analyes a thorough as possible, I also looked at the results of candidates in swing states versus the results of candidates in non-swing states to see if there was a noticable difference there.  

With a R-squared value of just 0.077, it was inconcolusive whether there was a tangible impact of campaign fundraising on electoral outcome.  After conducting analyses of both swing states and non-swing states, there was a noticable difference between the two.

When it comes to swing states such as Georgia or Arizona, there is a positive correlation between the money that a candidate raises and the result of the election. 
This result makes sense since being in a swing state indicates that the race would be closer, so a candidate spending more money on advertisements, GOTV efforts, etc., would help that candidate outlast his/her opponent.  

On the other hand, in non-swing states like Kentucky and South Carolina, candidates that spent much more than their opponents did not end up winning their races.  Take Kentucky for example: Amy McGrath, the Democrat, raised over $96 million, while her opponent Mitch McConnell raised just $69 million. However, McConnell beat McGrath by over 20 points in the election.  This also makes sense given the fact that Republican candidates in safe-Republican states (and vice versa) don't have to spend as much money to win given their constituents' already-embedded preferences.
