# senate_fundraising_analysis

In this project, I set out to determine whether the amount of money raised by a U.S. Senate candidate had an empirical effect on his or her result in the election.  I used data from the 2020 General Election, collecting information from the 20 candidates who raised the most cash.  

In order to make the analyes a thorough as possible, I also looked at the results of candidates in swing states versus the results of candidates in non-swing states to see if there was a noticable difference there.
